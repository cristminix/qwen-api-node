## ‚ú® Features

- **Prompt AI with various Qwen models**  
  Supports multiple models including: `qwen-max-latest`, `qwen-plus-latest`, `qwq-32b`, `qwen-turbo-latest`, `qwen2.5-omni-7b`, `qvq-72b-preview-0310`, `qwen2.5-vl-32b-instruct`, `qwen2.5-14b-instruct-1m`, `qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct`, and `qwen2.5-72b-instruct`.

- **Streaming Response**  
  Get token-by-token output in real-time for interactive applications.

- **Synchronous & Asynchronous Support**  
  Seamless integration for both sync and async workflows with the same intuitive API.

## üì¶ Installation

To install the package, use:

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import * as dotenv from "dotenv"

// Load .env file from the current working directory
dotenv.config()

import { QwenAPI } from "./packages/qwen-api" // Importing from src to run directly with ts-node
import { ChatMessage } from "./packages/qwen-api/core/types/chat"

async function main() {
  const authToken = process.env.QWEN_AUTH_TOKEN
  const cookie = process.env.QWEN_COOKIE

  if (!authToken || !cookie) {
    console.error(
      "Error: QWEN_AUTH_TOKEN and QWEN_COOKIE must be set in your .env file."
    )
    process.exit(1)
  }

  const client = new QwenAPI(authToken, cookie)

  const messages: ChatMessage[] = [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "What is the capital Of Paris?",
    },
  ]

  console.log("Sending request to Qwen Chat API...")

  try {
    const response = await client.create({
      model: "qwen-max-latest", // Use the model name from the Python client
      messages: messages,
    })

    console.log("API Response:")
    console.log(JSON.stringify(response, null, 2))

    const content = response.choices[0]?.message?.content
    console.log("\nAssistant's Message:", content)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("\nAn error occurred:", error)
  }
}

main()
```

### File Upload Example

Here's how to upload a file and include it in a chat request:

```typescript
import * as dotenv from "dotenv"
import * as path from "path"

// Load .env file from the root of the project
dotenv.config({ path: path.resolve(__dirname, "./env") })

import { QwenAPI } from "./packages/qwen-api"
import {
  ChatMessage,
  TextBlock,
  ImageBlock,
} from "./packages/qwen-api/core/types/chat"

async function main() {
  const authToken = process.env.QWEN_AUTH_TOKEN
  const cookie = process.env.QWEN_COOKIE

  if (!authToken || !cookie) {
    console.error(
      "Error: QWEN_AUTH_TOKEN and QWEN_COOKIE must be set in your .env file."
    )
    process.exit(1)
  }

  const client = new QwenAPI(authToken, cookie)

  // IMPORTANT: Replace this with the actual path to your image file.
  const imagePath = path.resolve(__dirname, "./tes_image.png")

  try {
    console.log(`Uploading image: ${imagePath}...`)
    const { file_url } = await client.uploadFile(imagePath)
    console.log(`Image uploaded successfully. URL: ${file_url}`)

    const messages: ChatMessage[] = [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: [
          {
            block_type: "image",
            url: file_url,
          } as ImageBlock,
          {
            block_type: "text",
            text: "ini gambar apa?",
          } as TextBlock,
        ],
      },
    ]

    console.log("\nSending multimodal request to Qwen Chat API...")

    const response = await client.create({
      model: "qwen-max-latest",
      messages: messages,
    })

    console.log("\nAPI Response:")
    console.log(JSON.stringify(response, null, 2))

    const content = response.choices[0]?.message?.content
    console.log("\nAssistant's Message:", content)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("\nAn error occurred:", error)
  }
}

main()
```

## üìÇ Documentation

## in progress

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

To use `qwen-api`, you need to obtain your `AUTH TOKEN` and `COOKIE` from [https://chat.qwen.ai](https://chat.qwen.ai). Follow these steps:

To use Alibaba Cloud OSS functionality, you'll also need to ensure you have the SDK installed:

```bash
poetry add oss2
```

1. **Sign Up or Log In**
   Visit [https://chat.qwen.ai](https://chat.qwen.ai) and sign up or log in to your account.

2. **Open Developer Tools**

   - Right-click anywhere on the page and select `Inspect`, or
   - Use the shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
   - Navigate to the `Network` tab

3. **Send a Message**
   Go back to [https://chat.qwen.ai](https://chat.qwen.ai) and send a message in the chat.

4. **Find the `completions` Request**
   In the `Network` tab, filter by `Fetch/XHR` and locate a request named `completions`.

5. **Copy the Authorization Token and Cookie**

   - Click the `completions` request and go to the `Headers` tab.
   - Look for the `Authorization` header that starts with `Bearer`, and copy **only the token part** (without the word "Bearer").
     Example:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
     ```
   - Scroll down and find the `Cookie` header. Copy the entire value.
     Example (partial):
     ```
     Cookie: cna=lyp6INOXADYCAbb9MozTsTcp; cnaui=83a0f88d-86d8-...; token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
     ```

6. **Save in `.env` File**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and paste the following:

   ```env
   QWEN_AUTH_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...  # no "Bearer"
   QWEN_COOKIE="cna=lyp6INOXADYCA...; cnaui=83a0f88d-86d8-...; token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
   ```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**:

- Never share your token or cookie publicly.
- Tokens and cookies may expire. If authentication fails, repeat the steps above to obtain a new one.
